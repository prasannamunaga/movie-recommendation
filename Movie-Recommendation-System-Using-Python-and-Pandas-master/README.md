ðŸŽ¥ Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to provide personalized recommendations. It can be used as a standalone application or integrated into larger platforms like streaming services or movie databases.

Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on what similar users have liked.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies that are similar to the ones the user has rated highly.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on genre, cast, directors, etc., that match the user's interest.
Hybrid Model: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for movies within the dataset.
Scalable: Can be adapted for large datasets.
